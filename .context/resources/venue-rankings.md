## Data Files

Static CSV data for programmatic lookups:

| File | Contents | Records |
|------|----------|---------|
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/abs_ajg_2024.csv` | CABS AJG 2024 journal rankings | 1,822 journals |
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/wbs60.csv` | WBS 60 membership list ([University]), AJG-enriched | 60 journals |
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/ft50.csv` | FT 50 membership list (Financial Times), AJG-enriched | 50 journals |
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/core_2026.csv` | CORE ICORE 2026 conference rankings (A*–C) | ~800 conferences |
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/scimagojr-2025.csv` | Scimago Journal Rank 2025 (SJR score, quartile, 2yr citations/doc, ISSNs) | ~30k journals |
| `.context/resources/venue-rankings/CABS-AJG-2024.xlsx` | Original CABS spreadsheet (reference only) | — |

### WBS 60 / FT 50 schema

Both `wbs60.csv` and `ft50.csv` are **membership lists** (no internal tier — a journal is either on the list or not). Schema:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `title` | Canonical title from `packages/atlas-workspace/src/atlas/data/venue_lists.py` |
| `print_issn`, `e_issn`, `field`, `ajg_2024` | AJG-enriched columns (empty for venues outside AJG scope, e.g., Nature, Science, PNAS) |
| `on_wbs60` / `on_ft50` | Membership flag (always `1` for entries in the file) |

These CSVs are **derived from** `packages/atlas-workspace/src/atlas/data/venue_lists.py` (the canonical Python source). To regenerate after editing the lists, import `WBS_60` / `FT_50` from `atlas.data.venue_lists` and emit CSVs with the schema above.

### SJR CSV schema

`scimagojr-2025.csv` is semicolon-delimited, European decimal format. Key columns: `Issn` (space-separated, no hyphens), `SJR`, `SJR Best Quartile` (Q1–Q4), `Citations / Doc. (2years)` (IF-like metric, Scopus-based), `Categories` (category-scoped quartiles).

Backfill script: `.scripts/venue-metrics/backfill-venues.py` — populates `scimago:` and `impact_factor:` fields on vault venue files.
