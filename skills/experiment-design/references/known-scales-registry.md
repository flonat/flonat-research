# Known Scales Registry

> Validated psychological and behavioural scales for recognition during QSF parsing and survey construction.
> Read during Survey mode of `experiment-design`.

## How to Use This Registry

1. **QSF parsing:** Match question items against known scales to identify validated instruments
2. **Survey construction:** Recommend appropriate scales for measured constructs
3. **Quality check:** Flag modifications to validated scales (changed items, altered anchors)
