# Deep Verification Mode

> Triggered by: `--deep-verify` flag, or when the .bib has 40+ entries, or when the user says "deep verify" / "verify all references".

This mode spawns parallel sub-agents that each verify a batch of entries and write structured results to disk -- bypassing context window limits entirely.

## Standard Forbid-List for Verification Sub-Agents

**Paste this block into every verification sub-agent prompt** (per `<rules-root>/subagent-prompt-discipline.md` § Standard Forbid-List for Write-Capable Sub-Agents). Verification sub-agents shell out to the scholarly CLI to verify DOIs but are otherwise read-only.

```
## Scope of action — DO NOT do these things

This sub-agent has a narrow scope: verify the assigned batch of DOIs
via the scholarly CLI, write the JSON results to /tmp/bib-verify-<N>.json,
and return a short summary. Do NOT do any of the following:

- Do NOT modify the project's `.bib` file. The orchestrator merges
  results.
- Do NOT modify any `.tex` file.
- Do NOT run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or any other git
  write command.
- Do NOT run `latexmk` or any build command.
- Do NOT edit `.context/`, `MEMORY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any project
  documentation.
- Do NOT stage entries under `.paperpile-import/` or write `\CiteTodo`
  placeholders; the orchestrator's fix-mode handles Paperpile staging/sync.
- Do NOT create files outside the assigned /tmp output path.

Return only your batch's verification results. The orchestrator
consolidates.
```

## Architecture

Sub-agents shell out to the `scholarly` CLI (`uv run scholarly ...` or the `~/.local/bin/scholarly` shim) — the CLI works in both the main context and sub-agents, unlike client-scoped connector calls.

```
You (orchestrator)
+-- Read .bib file, extract all entries
+-- **Pre-verify all DOIs via CLI:**
|   +-- Run: scholarly scholarly-verify-dois --dois D1,D2,... --json (max 50 per call)
|   +-- Write results to verification_results/preverify.json
+-- Create verification_results/ directory in project root
+-- Batch entries into groups of 5
+-- Spawn parallel agents (max 5 concurrent), each:
|   +-- Read preverify.json for pre-verified DOI status
|   +-- For each entry in batch:
|   |   +-- If DOI pre-verified as VERIFIED: check title match only
|   |   +-- If DOI NOT_FOUND or SINGLE_SOURCE: verify via `scholarly` CLI or Crossref API (curl)
|   |   +-- Check title matches DOI metadata
|   |   +-- Check author consistency
|   |   +-- Check year correctness
|   |   +-- Check for published version if preprint (via `scholarly scholarly-search` or web search)
|   +-- Write results to verification_results/batch_N.json
+-- Wait for all agents to complete
+-- Read all batch JSON files
+-- Merge into verification_results/full_report.json
+-- Generate markdown summary highlighting entries needing attention
```

## Batch JSON Format

Each agent writes a file `verification_results/batch_N.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "cite_key": "Author2020-ab",
    "doi_valid": true,
    "title_match": true,
    "author_match": true,
    "year_correct": true,
    "preprint_status": "published_version_exists",
    "published_doi": "10.1234/...",
    "issues": [],
    "suggested_fixes": {}
  }
]
```

## Agent Prompt Template

Each sub-agent receives:
- The batch of .bib entries (raw text)
- The batch number
- The output path: `verification_results/batch_N.json`
- The path to `verification_results/preverify.json` (pre-verified DOI results from orchestrator)
- Instructions to use the **`scholarly` CLI** (`scholarly scholarly-verify-dois --dois ... --json`, `scholarly scholarly-search "<title>" --json`) for DOI and title verification; fall back to **Crossref REST API** (`curl -sL "https://api.crossref.org/works?query.bibliographic=..."`) and **web fetch** for sources not covered by the CLI
- Instruction to write results to disk only -- never return large payloads

## Assembly & Report

After all agents complete:
1. Read all `verification_results/batch_*.json` files
2. Merge into `verification_results/full_report.json`
3. Generate `verification_results/summary.md` with:
   - Total entries verified
   - Entries with issues (grouped by issue type)
   - Suggested fixes
   - Entries needing manual attention
4. Print the summary to the user

## Cleanup

After the report is delivered, offer to delete `verification_results/` or keep it for reference.
