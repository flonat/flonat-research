# /meetings-debrief

Post-meeting analysis that reads your latest recording, compares what happened to what you planned, and surfaces decision evolution — so nothing falls through the cracks.

## How it works

This is a multi-phase interactive flow. It connects to `/meetings-prep` when a prep file exists, creating a before→after loop.

### Phase 1: Find the most recent recording

```bash
minutes list --limit 5
```

Pick the most recent recording. If there are multiple from today, ask via the available structured-question mechanism: "You have [N] recordings today. Which one are you debriefing?" with options listing the titles.

**If no recent recording exists:**
Say: "I don't see any recent recordings. Did you run `minutes record` and `minutes stop`? If the recording is from a specific meeting, tell me the title or date and I'll find it."

Don't proceed without a recording to debrief.

### Phase 2: Read the transcript

Use `Read` on the meeting file path. Extract from the transcript and frontmatter:

- **Decisions made** (from `decisions:` frontmatter or `## Decisions` section)
- **Action items created** (from `action_items:` frontmatter or `## Action Items` section)
- **Key discussion points** (from `## Summary` or the transcript itself)
- **Attendees** (from `attendees:` frontmatter)

### Phase 3: Check for matching prep

Look for a prep file that matches this meeting:

```bash
ls ~/.minutes/preps/ 2>/dev/null
```

Match logic:
1. Find `.prep.md` files from today or yesterday (within 48 hours)
2. Read each file's `person:` frontmatter field
3. Compare against the recording's `attendees:` list — match on first name
4. If multiple preps match → the available structured-question mechanism to pick which one
5. If no prep matches → standalone debrief (skip to 4.2)

### Phase 4: Debrief

Two paths depending on whether Phase 3 found a matching prep file.

#### 4.1 Prep-connected debrief (when a matching prep exists)

Read the prep file. Pull out the `goal:` field. Ask via the available structured-question mechanism:

"You went into this meeting wanting to: **[goal from prep]**

Did you accomplish it?"

Options:
- **A) Yes — fully resolved** → Mark as complete. Summarize what was decided.
- **B) Partially — some progress** → Ask: "What's still open?" Capture the remaining items.
- **C) No — it didn't come up or it changed** → Ask: "What happened instead?" Capture the pivot.
- **D) The goal changed during the meeting** → Ask: "What's the new direction?"

Then produce the debrief summary with the prep comparison:

```
## Debrief: [Meeting Title]

### Prep vs Reality
- **Goal:** [from prep]
- **Outcome:** [resolved / partially / pivoted]
- **What changed:** [if anything]

### Decisions
- [list each decision]

### Action Items
- [list with assignee and due date]

### Relationship Update
- [any notable changes in tone, new topics, shifted priorities]
```

#### 4.2 Standalone debrief (no matching prep)

Produce a straightforward debrief:

```
## Debrief: [Meeting Title]

### Key Decisions
- [list each decision]

### Action Items
- [list with assignee and due date]

### Notable Discussion Points
- [2-3 most significant things discussed]
```

### Phase 5: Decision evolution check

Search for prior decisions on the same topics discussed in this meeting:

```bash
minutes search "<topic>" --limit 10 --since <30-days-ago>
```

For each topic that has a decision in this meeting AND a decision in a prior meeting:
- Compare the decisions
- If they differ → surface the evolution:

"**Decision evolution — pricing:**
- Mar 3 (with Case): $599
- Mar 10 (with Alex): annual billing
- Today: monthly billing
- Status: **VOLATILE** (3 changes in 14 days)

Is this settled now, or still in flux?"

Classification:
- **STABLE** — Same decision held across 2+ meetings
- **VOLATILE** — Decision changed 2+ times in 14 days
- **CONFLICTING** — Two different active decisions exist on the same topic
- **NEW** — First decision on this topic

### Phase 6: Closing ritual

End with three beats:

1. **Signal reflection** — Quote something specific from the meeting or the debrief conversation.
   "You said '[quote]' — that sounds like the decision is locked."

2. **Assignment** — One concrete follow-up action.
   "Send Alex the pricing doc tonight while the conversation is fresh."
   "Update the roadmap doc with today's Q2 timeline change."

3. **Next skill nudge** — "At the end of the week, run `/meetings-weekly` to see how all your meetings connect and what still needs attention."

### Phase 7: Update persistent relationship file

After the debrief is complete, update the persistent relationship file for each attendee (other than the user):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.minutes/relationships
```

Write or update `~/.minutes/relationships/{first-name}.md`:

```markdown
---
person: {full name}
last_updated: {today ISO}
total_meetings: {count}
first_meeting: {date}
last_meeting: {today}
---

## Relationship Summary
{1-2 sentences: who they are, how the user knows them, their role}

## Active Topics
{bulleted list of topics currently active with this person — add new, remove stale}

## Communication Style
{direct/indirect, question-asker/proposer, tends to push back on X, etc.}

## Open Threads
{unresolved decisions, pending commitments between user and this person}

## Historical Decisions
{key decisions made with this person, most recent first, max 10}

## Notes
{any persistent context: their priorities, preferences, quirks}
```

**Update rules:**
- If the file exists, merge new information (don't overwrite — append to Active Topics, update Open Threads, add to Historical Decisions)
- Move resolved threads from "Open Threads" to "Historical Decisions"
- Remove topics from "Active Topics" if they haven't come up in 30+ days
- Keep the file under 100 lines — prune old historical decisions beyond 10 entries
- Set permissions: `chmod 600`

This file persists across sessions and is read by `/meetings-prep` to build richer briefs without re-searching all meetings from scratch.

## Gotchas

- **Don't hallucinate if there's no recording** — If `minutes list` returns nothing, say so. Don't invent a debrief.
- **Stale preps (>48h) are ignored** — If the prep file is more than 48 hours old, treat it as no-prep mode. The prep was for a different context.
- **First-name matching for prep files** — The prep file slug uses first name only (`sarah.prep.md`). Match against attendee first names in the recording frontmatter. "Alex C." matches "sarah".
- **Multiple recordings today** — Ask which one. Don't assume the most recent is the right one.
- **Recordings without frontmatter** — Some recordings only have raw transcripts (no summary, no decisions section). Work with what you have — extract decisions and action items from the transcript text yourself.
- **Decision evolution can span weeks** — Search the last 30 days for related decisions, not just this week.
- **Don't be preachy about decision changes** — Decisions change for good reasons. Surface the evolution factually. "Here's what shifted" not "You keep changing your mind."
- **Relationship files are sensitive** — They contain accumulated intelligence about people. Always 0600 permissions.
