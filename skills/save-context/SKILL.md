# Save to Context Library

Save information from the current conversation to the user's task management context files for future reference.

## Context Library Location

```
$TM/.context/
```

## Available Context Files

### 1. Profile (`profile.md`)
**Save here:** Personal details, roles, research areas, working style, preferences

**Triggers:**
- "Add this to my profile"
- "Remember that I prefer..."
- "Save my research interests"

**Format:** Update the relevant section, preserving existing content

### 2. Current Focus (`current-focus.md`)
**Save here:** What the user is actively working on, recent progress, next steps

**Triggers:**
- "Update my current focus"
- "I'm now working on..."
- "Save where I left off"

> **Preferred:** For structured end-of-session updates, use `update-focus` instead. It preserves the full document structure and handles session rotation, open loops, and mental state. Use `save-context` only for quick, targeted saves (e.g., adding a single note or updating one field). If `update-focus` is not available, read the file first and merge carefully — never overwrite with a blank template.

**Format:** Read the existing file and update the relevant section. Do not use a template — the file has a rich structure that must be preserved.

### 3. Projects Index (`projects/_index.md`)
**Save here:** Project overviews, paper status, collaborations

**Triggers:**
- "Add this project"
- "Update my journal paper status"
- "Save this research idea"

**Format:** Update the appropriate table or section

### 4. Individual Project Files (`projects/papers/[name].md`)
**Save here:** Detailed notes on specific papers/projects

**Triggers:**
- "Save these notes to my [project] file"
- "Create a project file for [name]"

**Format:** Create new file if doesn't exist:
```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Status
[Current stage]

## Key Decisions
- [Important choices made]

## Notes
[Detailed notes]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Tasks]
```

### 5. People (`people/supervisors.md` or `people/collaborators.md`)
**Save here:** Information about supervisors, collaborators, contacts

**Triggers:**
- "Add [name] to my contacts"
- "Remember that [person] works on..."
- "Save [person]'s details"

**Format:**
```markdown
### [Name]
- **Institution:** [Where they work]
- **Role:** [Their position]
- **Collaboration:** [What you work on together]
- **Contact:** [Email/preferred method]
- **Notes:** [Relevant context]
```

### 6. Preferences (`preferences/`)
**Save here:** Task naming conventions, priority definitions, workflow preferences

**Triggers:**
- "Remember I prefer tasks named like..."
- "Save my priority rules"

### 7. Workflows (`workflows/`)
**Save here:** How the user wants certain processes to work

**Triggers:**
- "Update my daily review workflow"
- "Change how I want meetings processed"

## How to Save

### Step 1: Identify the target file
Based on the information type, determine which context file to update.

### Step 2: Read the existing file
Always read the current content first to preserve existing information.

### Step 3: Merge intelligently
- Don't overwrite existing content unless explicitly asked
- Add new information in the appropriate section
- Update timestamps where relevant

### Step 4: Write the updated file
Save the merged content back to the file.

### Step 5: Confirm
Tell the user what was saved and where:
> "Saved to `.context/[file]`: [brief summary of what was added]"

## Examples

**User:** "Remember that my supervisor is a co-author, he specialises in multi-objective optimisation"

**Action:**
1. Read `.context/people/supervisors.md`
2. Find or create the Supervisor section
3. Update with: Name: a co-author, Focus: Multi-objective optimisation
4. Save file
5. Respond: "Saved to `.context/people/supervisors.md`: Added a co-author as your supervisor (multi-objective optimisation)"

---

**User:** "Update my current focus - I'm now deep in the journal revision, specifically rewriting section 4"

**Action:**
1. Read `.context/current-focus.md`
2. Update "What I'm Working On" section
3. Add timestamp
4. Save file
5. Respond: "Updated `.context/current-focus.md`: Now working on journal revision, section 4 rewrite"

---

**User:** "Save this meeting summary to my context"

**Action:**
1. Determine if it's project-specific or general
2. If project-specific: save to `projects/papers/[project].md`
3. If general: save key points to `current-focus.md`
4. Extract any action items and offer to create vault tasks

## Integration with vault

After saving to context files, offer to:
- Create related tasks in vault tasks
- Update Research Pipeline if paper-related
- Link context to specific vault files

## Tips

- Always preserve existing content unless asked to replace
- Use timestamps for time-sensitive information
- Keep entries concise but complete
- Cross-reference between files when relevant
