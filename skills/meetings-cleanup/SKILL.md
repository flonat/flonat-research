# meetings-cleanup

Help the user manage disk space and organize old recordings.

## Check current usage

```bash
# Total disk usage for meetings
du -sh ~/vault/meetings/

# Breakdown: audio vs transcripts
echo "Audio files:"; find ~/vault/meetings -name "*.wav" -exec du -ch {} + 2>/dev/null | tail -1
echo "Transcripts:"; find ~/vault/meetings -name "*.md" -exec du -ch {} + 2>/dev/null | tail -1

# Count by type
echo "Meetings: $(find ~/vault/meetings -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"
echo "Memos: $(find ~/vault/meetings/memos -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"

# Largest files
find ~/vault/meetings -type f -exec du -sh {} \; | sort -rh | head -10
```

Present this to the user before taking any action.

## Common cleanup tasks

### Delete WAV originals (biggest space saver)

After transcription, the original `.wav` files are no longer needed for search or recap. They only matter if you want to re-transcribe with a better model.

```bash
# List WAV files and their sizes
find ~/vault/meetings -name "*.wav" -exec du -sh {} \;

# Delete them (ask user for confirmation first!)
find ~/vault/meetings -name "*.wav" -delete
```

### Archive old meetings

Move meetings older than N days to an archive folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/vault/meetings/archive

# Find meetings older than 90 days
find ~/vault/meetings -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -mtime +90

# Move them (confirm with user first)
find ~/vault/meetings -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" -mtime +90 -exec mv {} ~/vault/meetings/archive/ \;
```

Archived meetings won't appear in `minutes list` or `minutes search` (which only scans `~/vault/meetings/`), but they're still on disk if needed.

### Clean up processed voice memos

The watcher moves originals to `~/vault/meetings/memos/processed/` after transcription:

```bash
du -sh ~/vault/meetings/memos/processed/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Clean up stale state

```bash
# Remove stale PID file
rm -f ~/.minutes/recording.pid

# Clean old logs (keep last 7 days)
find ~/.minutes/logs -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete 2>/dev/null

# Remove last-result.json (transient)
rm -f ~/.minutes/last-result.json
```

## Gotchas

- **Never delete `.md` files without asking** — These are the transcripts. They're small and contain the actual value. WAV files are the space hogs.
- **Archived meetings are invisible to search** — `minutes search` only walks `~/vault/meetings/` and `~/vault/meetings/memos/`. If you need archived meetings searchable, configure QMD to index `~/vault/meetings/archive/` too.
- **WAV deletion is irreversible** — If the user might want to re-transcribe with a better model later, suggest keeping WAVs for recent recordings and only deleting old ones.
- **Audio is ~10 MB/minute, transcripts are ~1 KB/minute** — Deleting audio saves 99%+ of space while keeping all searchable content.
- **iCloud sync caveat** — If `~/vault/meetings/` is in an iCloud-synced folder, deleted files go to "Recently Deleted" and still count against storage for 30 days.
